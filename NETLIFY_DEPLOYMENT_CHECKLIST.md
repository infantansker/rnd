## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)
1. Install Node.js (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js via Homebrew (macOS)
   brew install node
   
   # Or download from https://nodejs.org/
   ```

2. Install Netlify CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

3. Login to Netlify:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

4. Deploy to Netlify:
   ```bash
   # For production deployment
   npm run netlify:deploy:prod
   
   # For staging deployment
   npm run netlify:deploy
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   # If npm is not available, try:
   npx react-scripts build
   
   # Or if you have Node.js installed:
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build/` folder to Netlify through the dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - Click "New site from Git" or "Sites" → "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Upload the `build/` folder

## 🔍 Post-deployment Verification

### 1. Test Authentication
- [ ] Visit your deployed site
- [ ] Navigate to the Login page
- [ ] Enter a valid phone number
- [ ] Click "Get OTP"
- [ ] Verify that invisible reCAPTCHA works (no "I'm not a robot" badge should appear)
- [ ] Check that OTP is sent successfully

### 2. Test Contact Form
- [ ] Navigate to the Contact page
- [ ] Fill out the registration form
- [ ] Submit the form
- [ ] Verify that the form data is processed by the Netlify function
- [ ] Check that you receive the email notification

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools → Console:
- [ ] No CSP violations
- [ ] No Firebase initialization errors
- [ ] No reCAPTCHA errors
- [ ] Firebase config logs appear correctly

### 4. Verify Network Requests
In Developer Tools → Network tab:
- [ ] Firebase API calls succeed
- [ ] reCAPTCHA requests succeed
- [ ] Netlify function calls succeed
- [ ] No blocked requests

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. "auth/internal-error" when sending OTP
**Solution**: 
- Verify CSP headers in `netlify.toml` include frame-src directive
- Check that reCAPTCHA size is set to 'invisible' in `Login.jsx`
- Ensure your domain is added to Firebase authorized domains

#### 2. Visible "I'm not a robot" badge appears
**Solution**:
- Verify the reCAPTCHA container has `display: none` style
- Check that reCAPTCHA size is set to 'invisible'
- Confirm Content Security Policy includes proper frame-src directive

#### 3. Contact form not working
**Solution**:
- Verify the endpoint is set to `/.netlify/functions/contact`
- Check that EmailJS environment variables are set in Netlify
- Review function logs in Netlify dashboard

#### 4. reCAPTCHA not loading
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for CSP violations
- Verify Content Security Policy includes Google domains
- Try disabling ad blockers

#### 5. Environment variables not loaded
**Solution**:
- Verify variables are added in Netlify Dashboard
- Check that variable names match exactly (REACT_APP_ prefix)
- Re-deploy after adding variables

#### 6. Firebase config not found
**Solution**:
- Check that `src/firebase.js` contains correct fallback values
- Verify Firebase project settings in Firebase Console
